# Group Agreement

## Communication Plan

1. When not together, use slack or text.
1. Don't rush to conclusions, ask everyone for their opinion.

## Conflict Plan

1. Take a vote on whatever the problem is. The majority of the group will decide which direction we go if we cannot unanimously make a decision.

## Work Plan

1. Using the whiteboard, delegate which components people are working on.
1. We will use the commit history to make sure everyone is contributing.

## Git Process

* We will all work on our own branches, merging them to master at least once a day.
* When you submit a PR, the other two group members will review it before merging.
